# Purely experimental Rails 7 app with Tailwind CSS for now...

Will contain Sidekiq and excluding Redis if possible to still utilise Sidekiq to it's fullest extent. Background jobs are one of the application priorities.

Definitely intend on using Hotwire with Stimulus and Turbo featuring in the application, there is potential for using an external JS framework such as React or Vue, depending on how it will interact with the application and Hotwire.
