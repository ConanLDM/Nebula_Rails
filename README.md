# Purely experimental Rails 7 app with Tailwind CSS for now...

Tailwind inserted during the Rails new command, there is opportunity for incorporating Bootstrap also if Tailwind does not provide everything I am looking to use for the application, however no concrete plan either way at this stage.

Contains Solid Queue for jobs.

Definitely intend on using Hotwire with Stimulus and Turbo featuring in the application.

Will be utilising commonly used gems such as Devise and Simple Form, along with gems for charts and other functionalities.

Recent changes: Incorporated Devise into the project for user authentication.
