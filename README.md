# Purely experimental Rails 7 app with Tailwind CSS for now...

Tailwind inserted during the Rails new command, there is opportunity for incorporating Bootstrap also if Tailwind does not provide everything I am looking to use for the application, however no concrete plan either way at this stage.

Will contain Sidekiq and excluding Redis if possible to still utilise Sidekiq to its fullest extent, the alternative will be Solid Queue instead of Sidekiq. Background jobs are one of the application priorities.

Definitely intend on using Hotwire with Stimulus and Turbo featuring in the application, there is potential for using an external JS framework such as React or Vue, depending on how it will interact with the application and Hotwire.

Will be utilising commonly used gems such as Devise and Simple Form, along with gems for charts and other functionalities.
