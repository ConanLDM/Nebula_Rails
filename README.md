# Experimental Rails 7 app with Tailwind CSS for now...

Tailwind inserted during the Rails new command, there is opportunity for incorporating Bootstrap also if Tailwind does not provide everything I am looking to use for the application, however no concrete plan either way at this stage.

Contains a location section of the application, geocoding oriented.

Contains Solid Queue for jobs.

Intending on using Hotwire with Stimulus and Turbo featuring in the application.

Will be utilising commonly used gems such as Devise and Simple Form, along with gems for charts and other functionalities, such as RSpec for testing.

Recent changes: Incorporated Devise into the project for user authentication.
